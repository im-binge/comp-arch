There is no clear distinction between matters related to computer organization and matters relevant to computer architecture.

Principle of Equivalence of Hardware and Software:
	Any task done by software can also be done using hardware, and any operation performed by hardware can be done using software. (Assuming speed is not concern)

A computer is generally made up of three parts:
- processor to do data
- memory to store data
- mechanism to transfer data


Device specs:
- OS: Windows 11
- RAM: 16GB
- GPU: RTX 3060 + Intel
